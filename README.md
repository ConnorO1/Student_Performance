# Student_Performance
#### Looking at factors that influence test performance
+ Data retrieved from: https://www.kaggle.com/spscientist/students-performance-in-exams.
+ Initial EDA performed with SQL looking at summary statistics/ influence of various factors on test scores.
+ Data visualisaiton with matplotlib and seaborn.
+ Simple linear regression model built (MSE = 10 on test set)
#### Potential improvements:   
  - Categorical feature variables don't provide enough info to make accurate prediction
  - One test score could be included in model as a feature
  - SVM (regressor), NN or Decision tree regressor(and variants) could also be tested and compared
